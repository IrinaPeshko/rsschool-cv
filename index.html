      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        During my life I have tried many professions. I started working when
        I was in school. I have been a roller skating trainer and shop
        assistant, animator and video editor, administrator and speech therapist.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each of these professions has given me experience and skills.
        I learned how to communicate with clients and employers,
        work in a team and quickly memorize new information.
      </p>
      <p>
        All these professions have shown me that my main quality.
        I like to learn something new and immersing myself in
        complex topics.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's why I would like to become a Web Developer.
        This occupation provides endless possibilities for professional
        growth. You not only can you should learn all the time to keep
        up with the times.
