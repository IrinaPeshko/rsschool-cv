## **About me**
During my life I have tried many professions. I started working when I was in school. I have been a roller skating trainer and shop assistant, animator and video editor, administrator and speech therapist.

Each of these professions has given me experience and skills. I learned how to communicate with clients and employers, work in a team and quickly memorize new information.

All these professions have shown me that my main quality. I like to learn something new and immersing myself in complex topics.

That's why I would like to become a Web Developer. This occupation provides endless possibilities for professional growth. You not only can you should learn all the time to keep up with the times.

## **Code Examples**
My first task on CODEWARS:

Complete the method/function so that it converts dash/underscore delimited words into camel casing. The first word within the output should be capitalized only if the original word was capitalized (known as Upper Camel Case, also often referred to as Pascal case). The next words should be always capitalized.

```
function devide(str, devider) {
  return str
    .split(devider)
    .map((item, index) =>
      index == 0 ? item : item[0].toUpperCase() + item.slice(1)
    )
    .join("");
}
function toCamelCase(str) {
  return devide(devide(str, "_"), "-");
}
```
