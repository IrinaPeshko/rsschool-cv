## **About me**
During my life I have tried many professions. I started working when I was in school. I have been a roller skating trainer and shop assistant, animator and video editor, administrator and speech therapist.

Each of these professions has given me experience and skills. I learned how to communicate with clients and employers, work in a team and quickly memorize new information.

All these professions have shown me that my main quality. I like to learn something new and immersing myself in complex topics.

That's why I would like to become a Web Developer. This occupation provides endless possibilities for professional growth. You not only can you should learn all the time to keep up with the times.
